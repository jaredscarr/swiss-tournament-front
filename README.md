# Swiss Tournament Front End

This is the front end code meant to pair with the swiss-tournament API.

## Setup
This assumes the swiss-tournament repo setup is already complete and has local server started.

1 .Clone the repo
2. Create .env file with API_BASE_URL set to the host of the fastAPI app you should already have setup
3. run npm install.
4. npm run build
5. npm start

### Note

This was a project to remind myself of vanilla Javascript. Honestly, I would use a framework
next time :-)
